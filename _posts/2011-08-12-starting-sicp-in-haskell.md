title: Starting SICP in Haskell

Let me introduce the uninformed reader to
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/). It is a
(free) book and a course originally introduced in MIT as an introductory series in Computer
Science. Despite the fact that the first edition of the book dates back to 1985 (!) and that it uses Lisp (Scheme) as the main programming language, the book sustains a small but strong
fellowship to this day. Why? Antti Sykari describes on
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711/what-is-the-single-most-influential-book-every-programmer-should-read):

>"It is a book that will enlighten you. It will evoke in you a passion for writing beautiful
>programs. Moreover, it will teach you to recognize and appreciate that very beauty. It will
>leave you with a state of awe and an unquenchable thirst to learn more. Other books may make
>you a better programmer; this book will make you a programmer."

So I've decided to read it and do the exercises. Not expecting to be blown away by the book as
I've had some prolonged exposure to algorithms and functional programming before, but why not 
fill up the holes in my knowledge and compensate for the lack of a proper CS degree?

The fun thing is that I will be doing it in Haskell.
I've picked up more Lisp than would be fair before starting this book and
instead decided to do it in a language I would be learning while reading. Haskell is
appropriate, being a functional language, but with its static type system, pervasive laziness
and purity, it will hopefully provide enough of a challenge. You can follow along at the
dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Pet3ris/sicp). Now this is lower priority than
work, studies and personal projects, but I expect to put up something every week. I wouldn't
want to end up owning one of the many unfinished SICP repositories in GitHub.

P.S. Fun fact about Lisp. 
A couple of years ago I had the preconception that Lisp was useful primarily for list processing
(hence the name) and would be an overly specific language to learn and use. I really only knew
C++ and as it later turned out was embarrassingly conservative. Now I've
[played around](http://www.go-hero.net/jam/11/multilang) with a couple of more languages
including ironically a fresh dialect of Lisp called [Clojure](http://clojure.org). My idea of
Lisp has been upraised to the extent that I wonder if that name was appropriate to begin with.
