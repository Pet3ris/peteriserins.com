After two days of hard work, apparently there was something worth
publishing, so here we are.

I have wanted to have a blog for a long time. After lots of reading
and playing around with Wordpress and posterous to no satisfaction,
I eventually stumbled upon Jekyll and was instantly sold. For a small
personal blog, it offers a good mix of flexibility and simplicity.
It is lightweight, easy to pick up and secure, features that are scarce
nowadays. If you haven't, by all means try it out, it is the one thing that
made this blog a reality.

As far as the direction of this blog, I have no clue at the moment.
Expect a healthy dose of math and code as well as some ad hoc material
once in a while. We'll see.

As I'm writing this, I realize that there is nothing apart from the
"up" link to signify the end of a post. I should probably think of something more meaningful.
