If you use an eReader, I'm sure you know the difference between a PDF and
ePub/mobi book. In the case of the Kindle, for the latter, you can change the
font and its size, look up words in the dictionary and even have the Kindle
read the book out loud to you. For a PDF, you are normally forced to resort to
landscape to get a reasonable text size and to not have to use the cumbersome
zoom feature.

There are plenty free eBooks about programming in PDF and/or HTML. The latter
can easily be ported to the eReader formats and some people have indeed been
doing that. Here I've tried to list the free ePub mobi programming books
that I've found on the web (mainly in [GitHub](http://github.com)). Note that
most eReaders do not support both formats, but that usually isn't a problem,
because you can use software like [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) to
convert between the two.  Credit goes to authors and porters. Happy reading!
